Why you saw the error

- Browsers block module imports and some network APIs when opening files over the `file://` protocol. Your console showed errors like `blocked by CORS` and `net::ERR_FAILED` because `index.html` imports `./assets/supabase-client.js` using ES modules â€” that requires serving files over HTTP(S).

Quick ways to run a local server (Windows PowerShell commands)

- Using Node (recommended if you have Node/npm):

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

- Using Python 3 (no install needed if Python is present):

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000 --directory public; Start-Process "http://localhost:8000"
```

- Using a simple npx one-liner:

```powershell
npx http-server public -p 8080
Start-Process "http://localhost:8080"
```

What to expect

- Open `http://localhost:5173` (or the port you used). The `file://` CORS errors will disappear and the ES module import `./assets/supabase-client.js` will load normally.

If you want, I can install the `live-server` dependency locally and run it, or adjust the scripts/ports to your preference.
